Hello,

My name is Ali and I am extremely interested in learning how to code. I recently graduated from Harvard University (Class of 2015) and am a Business Intelligence Analyst in the Sports & Entertainment industry. I love learning and am excited about the opportunity to enhance my knowledge of coding.
